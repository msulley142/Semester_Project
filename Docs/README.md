## Calibration 
As someone who struggles with ADHD, I often find it difficult to build better habits, break bad habbits and learn new skills. I tend to attempt and drop them when I lose interest or find it too hard or overwelming to learn. The Calibration web application is designed to help overcome those struggles and make it easier to track and hold yourself accountable for the goals you set.
