Tools: Github's Copilot Assistance, ChatGPT
 
Github's Copilot Assistance 
1. I used Github's Copilot for code completion on repeatative task. However,due to me reaching my usage quota, it was not used heavily on this assigment.

Chatgpt 
2. I used to ChatGPT to help identify mistakes that caused error messages, correct syntax issues and to fixed logic errors. Most of the errors I encountered were due to how I linked the urls. I also used chatgpt extensivly when creating html templates. I asked for a simple html/css layout as a starting point. The majority of the html code has been heavily edited by me and looks completly different from the template I generated originaly.

prompt example: How can I make the third box span three rows without pushing down the other rows in my dashboard layout?
